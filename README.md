DeeTree
=======

DeeTree is an example of decision trees using C# and F#. 
There  are some example assessments and making calculations.

It uses template method pattern, with a Action<T> property to bypass virtual overrides. 
As well as cost calculations and having more than 2 branches from each decision node, explanations of decision routing can be obtained after the client assessment has competled.

There are 2 console demos and some simple xunit bdd tests.
